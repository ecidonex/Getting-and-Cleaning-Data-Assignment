Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo hosts the R code and output file for the course project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course
from Johns Hopkins University.

The code requires the following dataset:
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
available at: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The code assumes all files are extracted into the working directory, and the folder structure of the dataset is preserved
This code requires the "plyr" package installed in R. 
The output of the code is a file, averages_only.txt which shows the mean value for the numeric observations that show mean or standard deviations, stratified by subject and activity
See the codebook of this repo and the README and features_info files of the original data for more information on the dataset and variables
