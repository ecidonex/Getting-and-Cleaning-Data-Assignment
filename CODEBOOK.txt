Getting and Cleaning Data Course Assignment

Assignment tasks:
create a script run_analysis.R that accomplishes the following functions:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Overview of data set:
 Smartphone data that captures the movement of 30 subjects performing 6 activities while wearing a smartphone.

Files used for this analysis:
 features.txt - names of the 561 features which are measured for each subject
 activity_labels.txt - name and numeric ID for the 6 activities
 train/X_train.txt - observations for a subset of 21 volunteers
 train/y_train.txt - the numeric ID for each activity in the X_train file 
 train/subject_train.txt - the numeric ID for each subject in the X_train and y_train files
 test/X_test.txt - observations for a subset of 9 volunteers 
 test/y_test.txt - the numeric ID for each activity in the X_train file 
 test/subject_test.txt - the numeric ID for each subject in the X_train and y_train files

The remaining files included with the dataset were not used in this analysis.

features_info.txt included with the initial dataset includes information on the included variables.

Variables generated with this analysis in the output averages_only.txt

"subject" = numeric ID of the subject
"activities"=  label for activity performed

The following variables denote mean values for the corresoponding observations in the raw data, stratified by subject ID and activity label
